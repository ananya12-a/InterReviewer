    "chat_gpt_repsonse": "Based on the feedback you received, it seems like your response may have been confusing or lacked clarity. Here are some suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Be concise and organized: Try to present your ideas in a clear and structured manner. Break down your response into smaller, understandable points instead of combining multiple ideas into long sentences.\n\n2. Use clearer language: Avoid excessive use of filler words like \"like\" or \"I think.\" Instead, use more definitive language to express your ideas. For example, instead of saying \"I think,\" you can say \"I believe\" or \"From my understanding.\"\n\n3. Provide accurate information: Focus on providing accurate and verifiable information in your response. It is crucial to demonstrate a solid understanding of the topic at hand. If you are unsure about certain details, it's better to admit it rather than guess.\n\n4. Address any doubts or confusion: If you sense that your interviewer shows doubt or confusion, ask for clarification on their concerns. Take the opportunity to further explain or elaborate on your points to ensure they understand your perspective.\n\n5. Practice and prepare: Technical interviews can be challenging, so it's crucial to practice and prepare thoroughly. Familiarize yourself with key concepts, review relevant materials, and practice articulating your thoughts clearly and concisely.\n\nRemember, improving your interview performance takes practice and learning from experiences. Use this feedback constructively and continue to refine your communication skills."
