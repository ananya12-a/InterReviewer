    "interviewee_transcript": "So I think that if you call for in as a system call, then you're creating a child process and child processes, share the same physical memory as their parent, I think, but they have, like, a new virtual address space because I'm pretty sure every process like, has its own virtual memory.",

    "chat_gpt_repsonse": "To improve your statement and avoid negative reactions, you can make a few adjustments and clarifications:\n\n\"So, if you invoke a system call like 'fork' in your code, it creates a child process. While the child process shares the same physical memory as its parent, it has its own separate virtual address space. This means that each process has its own unique virtual memory. This distinction allows processes to have isolated memory access and prevents interference or conflicts with other processes.\"\n\nBy providing a clear explanation with better organization and avoiding excessive use of filler words, your statement will be more concise and understandable to the interviewer."
