Clarify and display confidence: Instead of saying \"I've never, like, built a server or anything before,\" try to clearly express your experience level and qualifications. For example, say \"While I haven't had the opportunity to build a server in the past, I have a strong understanding of the underlying concepts and have gained valuable experience in related areas.\"\n\n2. Highlight relevant skills: Emphasize any related skills or experiences you have, even if they are not specifically building servers. Discuss any technology, troubleshooting, or technical problem-solving skills that you possess. This will demonstrate your ability to adapt and learn quickly.\n\n3. Show enthusiasm for learning: Express a genuine interest in expanding your knowledge and acquiring new skills. Assure the interviewer that you are eager to undertake new challenges and are confident in your ability to learn and grow.\n\n4. Demonstrate transferable skills: Share any experiences where you successfully applied your skills from a different field or context to achieve positive outcomes. This showcases your adaptability and problem-solving abilities, which are valuable in various technical roles.\n\n5. Highlight any courses or certifications: If you have taken relevant courses or obtained certifications in related fields, discuss them to showcase your commitment to self-improvement and continuous learning.\n\n6. Provide examples: Offer concrete examples of projects or situations where you successfully learned and applied new technologies or concepts. This helps affirm your ability to pick up new skills quickly and effectively.\n\nRemember, interviews are opportunities to present yourself and your abilities in the best light possible. By demonstrating confidence, enthusiasm for learning, and emphasizing your transferable skills and experiences, you can help alleviate any negative impression left by initial statements."
